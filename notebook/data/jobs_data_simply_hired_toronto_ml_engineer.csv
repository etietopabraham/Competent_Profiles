About the job

The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.

The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don't always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.

Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world's fast-paced business needs.

Responsibilities
Participate in research to develop solutions for real-world, large-scale problems.
Google is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status. We also consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. See also Google's EEO Policy and EEO is the Law.

Do you want to just build software, or do you want to build software that helps people improve their lives? Viamo is a mission-driven organization and communication platform that is supporting people in geographies with minimal access to the Internet (take a look at some examples of our impact here (https://viamo.io/case-studies/)). With everything that has happened in the past few years, many of us have reconsidered what we want to do with our lives and how we can make a meaningful impact. Viamo is a place where you can work with talented, driven, and thoughtful people to improve the world for the better. If that sounds intriguing, please read on…

We are looking for a passionate and experienced Staff / Senior ML/Data Engineer to design and develop high-quality, modern data-driven solutions to fulfill our mission. You will be building software that is currently used in 40+ countries (primarily across Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean) to give connectivity to people with limited technology. You will be part of a team that is building, scaling, and maintaining Viamo's products including our large-scale web application and communication platform that processes 4 million+ interactions a day and positively impacts millions of lives. In the years ahead, we are aiming to scale our platform strategy to go beyond sharing information: connecting 100 million active users to vital services and many of the benefits of the digital economy.

All our users need is a simple mobile phone and a mobile connection to get access to vital information and services. Through channels such as text messaging and Interactive Voice Response (as well as internet-based channels such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp), end-users who are farmers, expectant mothers, small business owners, and others can get access to life-changing information. Throughout the COVID pandemic, Viamo's platform was key to efforts in many countries to get public health information out to hard-to-reach populations.

We are looking for a Staff or Senior-level Machine Learning/Data Engineer who has been doing ML-focused development for 8+ years with backend development experience. Ideally, has formal training in Computer Science or Software Engineering. Specifically, we are looking for an Engineer to help us design, build, and maintain scalable Machine Learning solutions that optimize our user's experience on our platform. Experience with recommender systems and personalization engines would be a huge asset.

The successful candidate will have experience with large-scale distributed systems and ML technologies coupled with a solid understanding of database and data analytics. It would be an advantage, although not a prerequisite, to have experience in some or all of our key tech stack components, including:

MySQL
BigQuery
Google Data Studio
PHP / Laravel

(The list above represents the key ones - we use many other technologies, including AWS, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins, BitBucket, etc.)

We are new to the world of Machine Learning, so we would expect you to help advise us on some of the tools and frameworks to use.

Strong written and verbal communication skills are a prerequisite, as we are a very team-oriented company working remotely with colleagues across the world, so clear communication is central to our success. We appreciate people who balance thinking long-term and pursuing technical excellence and are focused on delivering value to users. We are experienced Agile / Scrum practitioners and we operate in multi-disciplinary product crews towards shared success. If you are an independent, self-starting, and quality-minded developer with top-notch communication and analytical skills, we would like to talk to you.

About Viamo

At Viamo, we envision a world where all people have access to the information they need to make decisions for healthy, prosperous lives, and have meaningful relationships with governments, civil society, and businesses.

With more than 300 team members spread across 25 countries, and serving projects in more than 40 countries, we truly work on a global scale to catalyze a mobile tech movement. We are connecting nonprofits, governments, and businesses to the people they serve using the digital technologies they already have in their pockets (voice calls, interactive SMS, and social network chatbots). The majority of our Engineering team is based in Canada, but we have team members all over the world.

At Viamo, we value Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion. We know that diverse perspectives and experiences make our products, services, and teams stronger.

Did you know?

HR research shows that men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, but women and other under-represented people often apply only if they feel they check 100% of the requirements.

Industrial Measuring Systems manufactures and sells Measuring and Process Monitoring Systems for use in the metals industry, primarily focusing on the steel industry. We are looking for a self-starter to improve quality, design, marketing, and development of our current and future products.

The measuring systems use crazy-advanced 3D scanning lasers to calculate refractory thickness. We strap these lasers to the end of robotic arms and put them places they have no business being. The results are displayed using 3D graphics (currently written using DirectX 9, an upgrade is needed).

Our Process Monitoring System, DVIS (Data Video Integration System) is a revolutionary product that captures PLC and Video data from industrial settings, stores them in a custom-built time-series database, and makes the data available for clients that can connect to the server over a network.

Our systems collect a lot of raw time series and video data. This is ripe, and I mean RIPE for applying AI/machine learning to discern information from the data. It’s a classic ""Drowning in data but starving for information"" problem. Help.

A lot of our laser algorithms rely on the Iterative Closest Point algorithm. Has it been your lifelong dream to learn this algorithm inside out' If so, a job position with Industrial Measuring Systems Inc. might be for you.

Marketing' WHAT MARKETING. What is marketing. All of our sales have been by word of mouth. Imagine what we could do if we actually made a marketing effort. The same can be said for documentation. We need help with all of that.

The Software Engineer will work primarily with the managing software architect(s) and general manager.

About the job

The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.

The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don't always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.

Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world's fast-paced business needs.

Responsibilities
Participate in research to develop solutions for real-world, large-scale problems.

Handling over 1 trillion queries per day, our platform operates at an unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, ownership, empathy, and collaboration. We value the unique experiences and perspectives that each person brings to The Trade Desk, and we are committed to fostering inclusive spaces where everyone can bring their authentic selves to work every day.

Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a dynamic, globally-connected team where your contributions will make a meaningful difference in building a better media ecosystem? Come and see why Fortune magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among the best small-medium-sized workplaces globally.

About the Role:
Our Senior & Staff Data Engineers are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, building, and delivering data products for our clients.

You will work with petabyte-scale data challenges, large-scale distributed systems coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, machine learning, and advanced visualizations – to name a few.

You will work with data processing pipelines, ML pipelines, data processing automation, data governance, data visualization, data quality, data privacy, data warehousing.

Senior Engineers contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and/or direct management of small teams, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.

Who We Are Looking For:
You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful data engineering projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.

You understand engineering fundamentals. At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.

You have experience in data engineering. You've worked with SQL, ETL, data modeling, and technologies similar to Spark, Scala, C#, Java, etc..

You are a broadly skilled engineer, accustomed to developing web services. You have experience building always-on systems, working across a variety of technologies and service layers.

You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.

You work with confidence and without ego. Our engineers have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.

You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.

You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done"". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

What We Care About:
What and how you can contribute is what’s important to us. Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as an engineer, but we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.
Our culture runs much deeper than just having fun together (though, we do that well too...) – the people we want on our team are trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence.
Does this sound like you? If so, we welcome your application and the chance to meet you.

Are you ready to join the Winning Team not only building but actively managing the high-performing prediction and forecasting models behind automated risk-management decisions and forecasts that impact millions of customers and keep hundreds of $billions safe every single day?

Model Quality is all about ensuring that everything we build, we build right the first time, and we build them to last. The right candidate for this role is NOT someone who wants to design and build a handful of models each year but rather, is someone willing to take on the challenge of understanding how hundreds of them (spanning a wide range of problem types, employing a myriad of methodologies) work and can, commensurately, design and execute testing plans, and build capabilities to stress, test, and validate those models during pre and post implementation, and ongoing production runs.

This role will be a key member of Scotiabank’s Retail & Small Business Model Operations team responsible for ensuring that every part of the model lifecycle from development to implementation, deployment to management, and tracking to governance unfolds as effectively & efficiently as possible. In Model Operations, we are passionate about arming our stakeholders with the best data & tools possible so that they can build and run the best models possible. We obsess over getting things done quickly and done right, the first time. We leverage a combination of business / technical consulting, collaborative development and verification / testing in our approaches.

We get excited by automation. We love working with people; both internally with our peers (across business strategy, risk & technology) and externally with vendors alike. We make modelling easier and models easier to use.

Getting models to market quickly is important but getting them “right” is even more so. That is where you come in.

What Are We Looking For?

We are seeking someone who embraces the idea of being:
A key primary contributor (i.e., a thought leader and a doer) who ensures that all
advanced risk prediction and forecasting models, models that need to be not only accurate and precise, but highly stable, explainable, compliant, secure, and useful are implemented and monitored/reported properly
A subject matter expert, sharing best-in-class testing and acceptance practices to the department to be leveraged across all programs
A collaborative team player and owner who can prioritize projects and their own time to deliver the optimal balance of high value long-run results while remaining responsive to urgent and ever-shifting stakeholder needs

The ideal candidate for this role will be a consummate team player who is equally comfortable wearing the following hats:

Manager of Quality Assurance / Control / Testing
Data Engineer / Testing Automation Lead
Senior Data Analyst
Make an Impact

In this role, you will lead the testing of data changes, models, and crucial reporting impacting not just our partners but the bank’s quarterly financial filings both with investors and with the regulator.

You will collaborate on a regular basis with a wide range of stakeholders and internal partners including Model Owners (model developers), Technology & Data, the PMO, Capital Management, and Audit.

Is This Role Right for You?
You believe, first and foremost, in always doing the right thing and doing things the right way
You have demonstrated aptitude to design scenario-specific Test Approaches, Test Strategies & Plans, align test cases to requirements and user stories and select the appropriate test tools
You understand data engineering and modeling concepts to strategize and execute End to End testing cycles (Including data extraction, transformations and conversion)
You can evaluate test results, derive model and business insights, synthesize results and communicate high-quality recommendations effectively, both verbally, and in writing
You enable performance measurement by using standard metrics and drive continuous improvements
You ensure ongoing compliance with quality and industry regulatory requirements
Prepare quality documentation and reports by collecting, analyzing, and summarizing information and trends including failed processes, stability studies, corrective actions, and re-validations
You are willing and able to suggest and make framework enhancements to accommodate scripting needs for automation
You are curious, pragmatic, and a critical thinker
You have strong interpersonal skills and are able to interface and effectively influence at all organizational levels
You are professional, motivated AND FUN. We mean it.

Proven agility in fast-changing environments. As a scale-up, we’re constantly evolving so our people need to evolve too for us to succeed together.
A customer-centric outlook. Chances are you won’t be directly customer facing, but we value people who anticipate and prioritise the needs of our customers. We call it ‘inventing on their behalf.’

The Candidate Journey: Multi-Step and Two-Way

No-one wants to feel like a square peg in a round hole, so this process is designed to give you every chance to get the measure of us, and us of you. The various stages give you every opportunity to show your unique strengths and qualities, and enables each of us to establish if we’re a good fit for the other.
