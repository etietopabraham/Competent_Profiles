Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

Requirements

1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

At Affinity, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace, so if you’re excited about this role, but your past experience doesn’t perfectly align with the qualifications above, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

Required:
You have 3+ years of industry experience in software development.
You have a minimum of 2 years of experience with applied machine learning engineering in production.
You are a builder and care deeply about building systems and products that deliver meaningful value to users quickly and iteratively.
You have experience working with large, multi-terabyte datasets, and are comfortable with tools for high-scale data ingestion, transformation, analysis, and prediction.
You're excited to work collaboratively within engineering and across functional teams.
You’re eager to contribute your ideas and experiences to help Affinity continuously improve as a product and as a company.

Nice to have:
You have experience with NLP techniques and domains, including Named Entity Recognition, and Deep Learning.
Experience with Databricks and Delta Lake.
Experience working with AWS, Kubernetes.
Experience with entity resolution and enrichment-focused data pipelines.

How we work:
Our culture is a key part of how we operate as well as our hiring process:

We iterate quickly. As such, you must be comfortable embracing ambiguity, be able to cut through it, and deliver incremental value to our customers each sprint.
We are candid, transparent, and speak our minds while simultaneously caring personally with each person we interact with.
We make data driven decisions and make the best decision for the moment based on the information available.

Join us in enabling every professional on the planet to succeed by harnessing the power of their relationships.

What you’ll enjoy at Affinity:
We live our values as playmakers, obsessed with learning, care personally about our colleagues and clients, are radically open-minded, and take pride in everything we do.
Health Care coverage and flexible personal & sick days. We want our team to be happy and healthy :)
We provide an annual budget for you to spend on education and offer a comprehensive L&D program – after all, one of our core values is that we’re #obsessedwithlearning!

The goals of modern technology are not aligned with our goals as humans. We need technology to empower us to make life choices that benefit our human experience, not algorithmically addict us to our devices. The UpBeing Wellbeing application combines passive behavioural data streams like e-calendar, Spotify, wearables, and spending with short, research-grounded emotional check-ins to provide users unprecedented insight into the hidden relationships between their behaviours and feelings. As we grow our vision is to apply this same concept to communities and to society as a whole – measuring and imbuing emotion into the systems that make up our world.

UpBeing is also a way of thinking that is at the heart of our company. We believe every person is on their own personal journey towards flourishing. We want to move people up from their wellbeing baseline everyday and move their baseline up over time. We take this same approach as an employer, ensuring that the work we do together is meaningful and helps you grow as an individual. While we are a start-up today, our ambitions are huge. We are looking for junior team members that find meaning in and truly care about what we are building and want to grow personally and professionally. We are looking for people who, like us, want to build a more empathetic future that will infuse more emotions into an increasingly digital world.

The Role:
As an UpBeing Data Scientist, you will be an integral part of the team and help develop key insights, models and the underlying data analytics that is the backbone of our application. As an early UpBeing employee, you will have autonomy to move quickly and implement your ideas with the guidance and mentorship of our CTO. We also have a strong support network of investors, advisors and mentors we’ve surrounded ourselves with that you will be able to tap into and learn from. As a part of a small company with big ambitions, you’ll have the opportunity to take on new challenges and develop your experience and confidence. You’ll be exposed to the entire product development process from ideation to release and support. You will be able to ask any question and be given opportunities to try new things. Failing fast and taking risks will be encouraged and learning, as a company and as an individual, will be prioritized. You will understand the broader goals of the company and how your personal objectives fit into them.

As we are delivering statistical insights to users, there will be a strong focus on AI transparency and interpretability – If we deliver an insight to a user, but can’t explain how that insight was derived, it will dissolve trust in the system.

What You'll Do:
Work closely with the CTO and Lead Developer to understand and implement features within our B2C application.
Explore new datasets from new integrations enabled by our users and uncover insights within that data.
Research, innovate and develop cutting-edge machine learning models and algorithms with high-dimensional, complicated unstructured, and structured data.
Leverage machine learning models that can be used to deliver new insights to users and classify our dataset.
Understand and enhance our data pipeline balancing speed and scalability.
Brainstorm with the CTO on how to approach technical challenges.
Help run A/B testing experiments on new insights and features from a data perspective.
Help develop and maintain the framework for how we measure user value in the app.
Build robust and well-tested solutions.
Work closely with the Lead Developer as well as other business stakeholders outside of the data science function.
Communicate and document technical and architectural decisions.
Internalize UpBeing and what we stand for and consider our users in every decision you make.
Ensure privacy and security is imbued into everything you build.
Do and learn new, awesome things all the time.

What You Need to be Successful:
Formal education in a professional field or clearly demonstrated relevant professional experience.
Fluency in Python.
Experienced with Data Science and Machine Learning (aka A.I.), including Regression, Classification, Clustering, Ensemble Methods, Deep Learning, Active Learning, Reinforcement Learning, etc.

Solid interpersonal and collaboration skills and a demonstrated ability to work within a team.
Strong attention to detail.
Comfort working in a low overhead, low red tape, fast moving environment
Strong sense of humility, with a learning mindset and a drive to improve.
Strong troubleshooting and problem-solving skills.

Nice to Have:

Some experience with GCP technologies.
Expressed interest or previous experience in Wellness Tech, Health Tech, Mental Health Tech or a similar field.
Experience working with third-party contractors and partners.

UpBeing is setup remote-first with it’s HQ in Nova Scotia. It is preferred that applicants are authorized to work in Canada on a full-time basis now and in the future as this position does not offer sponsorship, however we are open to meeting with out-of-country candidates.

Affinity stitches together billions of data points from massive datasets to create a powerful, accurate representation of the world's professional relationship graph. Based on this data, we offer our users the insights and visibility they need to nurture and tap into the opportunities in their team's network.

In this role, you'll help create the magic that underlies Affinity's industry-leading relationship intelligence. You'll define how Affinity uses our massive datasets (including email messages, calendar events, and data pulled from around the public internet) to extract actionable information and create insights for our users to help them leverage their networks to effectively prospect and source deals, and more! We are early on in our journey of providing these actionable insights for our customers, and this role will be the technical expert in ML that will drive our progress on this front.

This is an applied machine learning position and not a research role. The expectation is that the candidate will be driving the development of our ML Ops and ML Engineering capabilities, as well as doing modelling work. We value short iterations that deliver value to our customers.

What you’ll be doing:
Take projects from ideation to production, including feature engineering, model construction, deployment, and model observability and evaluation.
Help define our data roadmap. Which problems are amenable to AI/ML techniques, and which are better solved via simpler non-statistical methods? How might we define and evaluate data and model quality? Which models and techniques are best suited to our domain? You'll collaborate with our product and engineering teams to help to answer these questions and more.
Collaborate with the rest of our data pipeline and ML engineering teams to build the robust, high-scale systems that underlie all of our data processing and ML Operations.

Qualifications

Don’t meet every single requirement? Studies have shown that women and people of color are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every qualification. At Affinity, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace, so if you’re excited about this role, but your past experience doesn’t perfectly align with the qualifications above, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

Required:
You have 10+ years of experience in software engineering and/or Machine Learning, with at least 5 years of experience with applied machine learning in production, focused on ML Engineering and ML Ops.
You have 2+ years of experience with NLP techniques.
Experience with live A/B testing at scale.
You are a builder and care deeply about building systems and products that deliver meaningful value to users quickly and iteratively.
You have experience working with large, multi-terabyte datasets, and are comfortable with tools for high-scale data ingestion, transformation, analysis, and prediction.
You're excited to work collaboratively within engineering and across functional teams.
You’re eager to contribute your ideas and experiences to help Affinity continuously improve as a product and as a company.

Nice to Have:
Experience with Databricks.
Experience with the AWS ecosystem.
Familiarity with using ML to improve data quality.
You have experience with recommendation systems and transfer learning.

How we work:
Our culture is a key part of how we operate as well as our hiring process:

We iterate quickly. As such, you must be comfortable embracing ambiguity, be able to cut through it, and deliver incremental value to our customers each sprint.
We are candid, transparent, and speak our minds while simultaneously caring personally with each person we interact with.
We make data driven decisions and make the best decision for the moment based on the information available.

Join us in enabling every professional on the planet to succeed by harnessing the power of their relationships.

What you’ll enjoy at Affinity:
We live our values as playmakers, obsessed with learning, care personally about our colleagues and clients, are radically open-minded, and take pride in everything we do.
Health Care coverage and flexible personal & sick days. We want our team to be happy and healthy :)
We provide an annual budget for you to spend on education and offer a comprehensive L&D program – after all, one of our core values is that we’re #obsessedwithlearning!
We support our employee’s overall health and well-being and reimburse monthly for things such as; Transportation, Home Internet, Meals, and Wellness memberships/equipment.

About the Role

This is a paid internship that will be undertaken over a six-month period with the potential to be hired by our client, Croptimistic Technology Inc, afterwards (note: at the discretion of the client). The intern will report to an Amii Scientist and regularly consult to and work with the Client team to share insights and engage in knowledge transfer activities.

About our Client

Croptimistic Technology Inc. is a Canadian Ag-Tech company with a goal of becoming the largest precision agriculture services company globally. Soil, Water, and Topography (SWAT) MAPS is the flagship product and the foundation for everything that they do. SWAT MAPS are high-resolution soil foundation maps used to execute variable rate fertilizer, seed, soil amendment, pesticide, or precision water management.

The SWAT Ecosystem encompasses a suite of hardware, software, and patented precision agriculture processes. The SWAT ecosystem is accessed by a global network of precision agronomy partners who utilize SWAT technology in delivering precision agriculture services to their farm customers. Farms using SWAT technology realize higher returns / acre, more even crops, reduced crop disease pressure, and greater crop harvestability with a lower environmental impact versus traditional fixed rate applications.

Croptimistic is a multi-disciplined company with technical experts located globally in agronomy, soil science, water management, geographic information systems, electronic sensor systems, and software development. Consistent investment in Research and Development has been a top priority since inception in 2018. Croptimistic excels in developing solutions to some of the most difficult challenges in agriculture technology.

About the Project

The R&D team at Croptimistic has developed a crop / weed imaging system called SWAT CAM to autonomously assess crop establishment by SWAT zone at early crop stages. SWAT CAM automatically captures thousands of images across fields while mounted to an agricultural field sprayer. These images are uploaded to the SWAT Records software platform where machine learning models are used to predict the crop population independent of the weeds for each image. The results are summarized by SWAT management zone so agronomists can analyze the effectiveness of variable rate strategies applied by zone. This project aims to develop machine learning techniques and eventual models for calculating plant populations for densely planted crops such as wheat, barley, oats, lentils, flax, and peas. This is a significant challenge because of the difficulty in manually counting densely populated plants.

This project will be conducted within a cross functional team environment with input required from R&D, agronomy, software development, and machine learning development teams throughout.

Very is a fully distributed IoT technology firm led by expert problem-solvers to create efficient, scalable solutions that move commercial, industrial, and consumer IoT projects from pilot to production in record time.

We’ve built a collaborative, tight-knit team that thrives, whether we’re hanging out in person at our annual retreat or coordinating work across time zones. The results show that we’re doing something right — as we’ve won numerous workplace awards over the years. Most recently in 2021 we were certified as a Great Place to Work, and in 2022 we were listed again in Parity.org’s list of Best Companies for Women to Advance.

We believe that everything we build — and the people we build it with — has the potential to change the world. Our client list includes numerous well-known brands determined to leverage the power of IoT to drive material outcomes — such as Vizio, Peloton, Clear, iHeart Radio and Fellowes. Our goal, for each and every client we partner with, is to create high-value solutions through a collaborative and user-centered process.

All our users need is a simple mobile phone and a mobile connection to get access to vital information and services. Through channels such as text messaging and Interactive Voice Response (as well as internet-based channels such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp), end-users who are farmers, expectant mothers, small business owners, and others can get access to life-changing information.

Description of the Position: Sunnybrook research institute is seeking an exceptional postdoctoral fellow to join the Sleep and Brain Health Laboratory (https://sleepandbrainhealth.ca/) to lead development of novel, automated, scalable approaches to the quantification of sleep physiology and identification of sleep disorders from human wearable sensor data in support of several large CIHR and NIH-funded clinical studies of sleep and dementia.

The fellow will apply contemporary machine/deep learning approaches to address problems in the classification of sleep physiology and the identification of sleep disorders using new low-profile human flexible wearable sensors. (electroencephalography, electrocardiography, accelerometry, photoplethysmography). The fellow will leverage several already-collected lab-based datasets including >3000 nights of gold-standard polysomnography, and >1600 hours of co-captured in-lab polysomnography, ambulatory EEG, accelerometry, and wearable adhesive sensor cardiopulmonary data. The resulting analytic approaches will then be applied to home-based wearable sensory data from several large ongoing NIH and CIHR funded cohort studies of older adults (>1000 nights of ambulatory EEG in adults with cognitive impairment, >60,000 nights of human accelerometry data from older adults with and without dementia, and >4000 nights of overnight cardiopulmonary data from older adults with and without dementia) to determine if sleep and other physiological characteristics identified using these approaches can predict dementia outcomes and dementia-related brain changes. In addition to data analysis and algorithm development, the fellow will also be involved in guiding students and staff involved in data collection.

The position requires working closely with the PIs Dr. Lim (sleep and circadian physiology, neurology, genetics) and Dr. Goubran (machine learning, computational neuroscience), and with graduate students, staff and developers in the lab to achieve these aims. New approaches and ideas are encouraged, as are independent projects that dovetail with current studies. There will be opportunities for multiple publications on novel analytic approaches to wearable sensor data for sleep, and the links between these data and dementia outcomes. Training in clinical research and in the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of human sleep physiological data will be provided.

This is a fully funded position. Salary is commensurate with experience and with CIHR/NIH stipend levels. Contract is renewable contingent on performance.

Required Qualifications:
PhD in received within the last 5 years or graduating PhD candidate in computer science, biomedical engineering, physics, computational neuroscience, or a related quantitative field
Solid publication record related to machine learning and signal processing
Interest in brain signal processing
Strong programming skills in MATLAB, R / Bioconductor, or Python
Ability to communicate complex information clearly, orally and in writing
Ability and willingness to work in a dynamic interdisciplinary team environment
Preferred Experience and Skills
Experience with machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, Theano, Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch
Python software packaging, virtual environments, Anaconda/Conda, Jupyter/IPython
Experience with version control systems (Git) and software testing
Experience with human EEG and other human physiological signal recording and analysis
